## How to Create Initial Commit in Latitude

### Option 1: Via Latitude Web Interface
1. Go to your Latitude project dashboard
2. Click "Create Prompt" 
3. Use path: `welcome/hello`
4. Paste the basic welcome prompt content
5. Save the prompt
6. This will create your first commit

### Option 2: Via Our Integration (After Initial Commit)
Once you have at least one prompt in Latitude, you can use our integration:

```python
from llm_eval.integrations.latitude import LatitudeIntegration, LatitudeConfig

# Configure integration
config = LatitudeConfig(
    api_key="your-api-key",
    project_id=20572
)
integration = LatitudeIntegration(config)

# Create a test prompt
result = await integration.client.create_prompt(
    path="test/initialization",
    content="This prompt initializes our evaluation framework integration.",
    description="Initial commit for LLM evaluation pipeline"
)
```

### Option 3: Simple Test Prompt for API Testing
**Path:** `test/api_connection`

**Content:**
```
API Connection Test

This is a simple prompt to verify that the Latitude project is properly initialized and can receive API calls from external integrations.

Please respond with: "Connection successful. Ready for evaluation framework integration."

Timestamp: {{current_time}}
Project: LLM Evaluation Pipeline
Integration: Hugging Face → Latitude → Evaluation
```

## Recommended First Steps

1. **Start Simple**: Use the basic welcome prompt first
2. **Test API**: Verify the integration works with a simple test prompt  
3. **Add Evaluation Prompts**: Create prompts specifically for your evaluation frameworks
4. **Push HF Data**: Use our integration to push real research dataset samples

## Sample Command for Testing

After creating the initial commit, test our integration:

```bash
# Test the basic connectivity
python test_latitude_integration.py

# Test HF dataset integration  
python test_hf_to_latitude.py
```

The "Head commit not found" error should be resolved once you have at least one prompt in your Latitude project!
